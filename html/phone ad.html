  <p><strong>How To Overcome Phone Additcion</strong> 
    <h2>
  </p>
  
  <p align="justify" class="style4">
  1.Don't let your phone be the last thing you see at night and the first thing you check in the morning. By using a regular alarm clock and charging your phone out of reach, you won't be tempted to start your day by getting vortexed into an avalanche of messages and updates. </p>
  
  <p align="justify" class="style4">2.The lesser notifications you receive, the less likely you are to check your smartphone. That’s because people are so addicted to their smartphones so much that it actually takes an effort to ignore notifications. Luckily, notifications can be limited so that they are not that much of a bother.
    Limit smartphone usag</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style4">3.Limit smartphone usage
    Now by this, we don’t mean that one should decide to not check their smartphones more than 20 times a day. But what can be done is to fix particular times when the device would be used and when it wouldn’t be. For instance, it’s advisable to keep smartphones away during meals or social gatherings.
  Get rid of unnecessary apps.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style4">4 .Get rid of unnecessary apps
    Social media apps like Facebook and Twitter are not absolutely essential on smartphones. This may sound like an impossible idea, but you can really do without them. The list of unnecessary apps is endless. This not only frees up time that can be utilized better, but also releases the device’s storage.
    
    Turn phone off before going to bed.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style4">5. Turn phone off before going to bed
    This should be pretty obvious, but it’s still not practiced by most people. Switch off the phone before going to sleep. It’s as simple as that. Hell won’t freeze over if your phone stays switched off for a few hours, and that’ll help you sleep better as well.
    Take help from apps.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style4">6 .Take help from apps
    There are a number of apps on the Play Store that actually help you limit your smartphone usage. Some of these include Rescue Time and AppDetox. You can download these apps and configure them as per your convenience to keep your smartphone usage under check.
    Use the old-fashioned way of keeping track of time.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style4">7.Use the old-fashioned way of keeping track of time
    It has almost become our second nature to grab our smartphones every time we want to know what time it is. But this is not where it stops. Once we check the time, we end up checking (and acting upon) everything from WhatsApp messages to emails.
    
    So it’s best to resort to wearing wrist watches one again, and relying only on them for checking time. Also, actual alarm clocks can be used instead of setting alarms on smartphones.
    Switch back to a feature phone.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style4">8.Switch back to a feature phone
    So if you have a serious smartphone addiction, and none of the above mentioned points help, you probably need an equally extreme measure to tackle the issue. You can actually use a feature phone for a few weeks, and then get back to a smartphone once you feel you have overcome your smartphone addiction. It won’t be easy, but it will be every bit worth it. </p>
